# What is this?
A simple tool for generating high load on server to simulate long tail effect.

# How does it work?
A large number of random matrices are generated by the `matrix_generator` component. Later, the `server` component reads them from disk and does LU decomposition on a randomly-selected matrix, in a concurrent way.

Consider running this tool on a HDD, since millions of small files will add highly uncertain I/O time to each request, which simulates I/O intensive tasks.

# How to use?
The `matrix_generator` and `server` components are written in Rust, so it's necessary to build them before using. The `client` component is written in Python so simply run it. It might be helpful to add some visualization or comparison codes to the `client`.

After getting all the binaries, run the following commands:

```
$ mkdir matrix #Folder where random matrices are stored
$ ./matrix_generator matrix 10000 100 1000 #./matrix_generator folder_name matrix_count minimum_dimension maximum_dimension
$ ./server matrix 8080 #./server folder_name port
$ python client.py 127.0.0.1:8080 10000 1000 > result.txt #Testing on the listening port, sending 1000 concurrent requests each time, 10000 requests in total, save the raw response times to file `result.txt`
#Or simply use `ab` to test
```
